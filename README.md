# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses.
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on customer churn data
to identify key factors that influence customer attrition and derive
actionable business insights.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
The objective of this analysis is to understand customer behavior patterns
and identify features that contribute to customer churn.

- Customer demographics
- Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Service usage details
- Billing information (monthly charges, total charges)
- Churn status (Target Variable)

---

## 🔧 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant identifiers
- Converted data types for numerical consistency
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Prepared clean data for analysis
